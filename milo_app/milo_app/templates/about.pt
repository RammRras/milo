				<p>Milo is a web application with the purpose of elaborating the best film recommendations for you!</p>
				<p>Personalize your profile after registering on Milo to a better and more refined recommendation.</p>
				<p>Typically, a recommender system compares a user profile to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the 'rating' that a user would give to an item they had not yet considered. These characteristics may be from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach).</p>
